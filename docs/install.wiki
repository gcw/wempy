<h2>Installing Wempy</h2>
If you're running python 2.5 - 2.7x, you can install wempy with pip: 

<verbatim>
$ pip install wempy
Downloading/unpacking wempy
  Downloading wempy-0.1.1.tar.gz
  Running setup.py egg_info for package wempy
Installing collected packages: wempy
  Running setup.py install for wempy
    changing mode of build/scripts-2.6/wempy from 644 to 755
    changing mode of /Users/gcw/.pythonbrew/pythons/Python-2.6.7/bin/wempy to 755

The wemplate.wemplate library may be compatible with python 2.4 but I do not actively test with it. <em>wempy<em> the command line utility is not compatible with any version prior to 2.5.
